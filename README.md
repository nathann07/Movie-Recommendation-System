# Movie Recommendation System

A collaborative filtering-based recommendation system using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), trained on the MovieLens dataset to generate personalized movie recommendations. This project demonstrates how to build, evaluate, and interact with a recommendation system using Python and the Surprise library.

## Project Overview
This recommendation system is designed to predict user ratings for movies they haven't seen and provide personalized recommendations. The model leverages collaborative filtering with SVD, a popular matrix factorization technique.

The notebook includes:
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Loading the MovieLens dataset and preparing it for training.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Training an SVD model and evaluating it using metrics like RMSE, Precision, and Recall.
- **Interactivity**: An input field for testing recommendations for any user in the dataset.

## Setup and Requirements

### Required Installations
To run this project, youâ€™ll need the following Python libraries. You can install them via pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-surprise scikit-learn ipywidgets notebook
```

### Running the Notebook
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nathann07/Movie-Recommendation-System.git
   cd movie-recommendation-system
```

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Open Jupyter Notebook, and in the Jupyter interface, navigate to the cloned project folder and open `movie_recommendation_system.ipynb`.

3. **Interact with the Notebook**:
   - **Train the Model**: Run each cell to load data, preprocess, train, and evaluate the model.
   - **Generate Recommendations**: Use the interactive input field in the notebook to type a user ID and view personalized movie recommendations.
